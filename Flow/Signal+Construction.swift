    /// An internal initializer for mapping `Event` based APIs to the underlying `EventType` based APIs.
    /// `EventType` and its APIs are an implemenation detail not currently being exposed in public APIs.
    /// Public APIs are instead working with `Event`s and "current values", typically provided through getters such as `getValue`.
    /// As signals can easly cause recursion, this initalizer also make firing of events "exclusive", that is, they will complete before another event is fired.
    /// Often it's not obvious when a recursion is caued, hence "exclusive" event handling should make it easier to reason about event callback code and in what order it is executed.
    /// Signaling of initial values (either none or a value retrieved from `getValue`) could also cause recursion, and need special handling to behave as expected.
    /// These two behaviours (exclusivity and initial recursion) can be illustrated by:
    ///
    ///     let callbacker = Callbacker<Event<Int>>()
    ///     var result = [Int]()
    ///     _ = Signal(callbacker: callbacker).start(with: 1).onValue { val in
    ///       result.append(val)
    ///       callbacker.callAll(with: .value(val + 1))
    ///       callbacker.callAll(with: .end)
    ///     }
    ///     assert(result == [1, 2])
    ///
    /// A basic implemenation of this initializer could have been e.g:
    ///
    ///     self.init(onEventType: { callback in
    ///       callback(.initial(getValue?()))
    ///       return onEvent { event in
    ///         callback(.event(event))
    ///        }
    ///      })
    ///
    /// But this would mean that we will not call `onEvent` (which will add a callback to the callbacker) until after the intital value was fired.
    /// But firing the initial value will be picked up by `start(with:)` to fire a real event casuing `onValue()` to
    /// be called with the value `1`. But when `onValue()`, on its turn, calls the callbacker, there are not yet any listeners as `onEvent` has not been called yet.
    /// Hence we will not receive any more events and `result` will be `[1]`.
    ///
    /// But even if we try to fix this by actually firing the initial value from inside `onEvent` if neccessarly, we will run into another problem.
    /// When we in `onValue()` signals `val + 1`, it will cause a recursion ending up in `onValue()` again, now with the value `2`.
    /// This will then continue forever until we blow up the stack, and code for firing the `.end` will never be reached.
    ///
    /// A solution is to make the firing "exclusive", that is, to let it finsish before potential recursive events are fired.
    /// In the example above this would mean that the recursive events from `onValue` will be queued up while `onValue` is executed,
    /// and once the firing of this initial value is done, the first queued up value `2` will fire, and while `onValue` is receiving the value `2`
    /// any new recursive events from `onValue` will be queued up as well. But then the the first `.end` is unqueued and fired, hence the signal is terminated.
    /// Thus we will get the expected result of `[1, 2]`
    ///
    /// Another, perhaps more realistic example:
    ///
    ///     let signal = ReadWriteSignal(1)
    ///     var result = 0
    ///     _ = signal.distinct().atOnce().onValue { val in
    ///       signal.value = 2
    ///       result = val
    ///     }
    ///     assert(result == 2)
    ///
    /// Without handling initial recursion or exclusivity, this would give a result equal to "1".
    /// If we just added initial recursion so `signal.value = 2` would cause a recursion and fire `2`,
    /// the result would be still be just "1", as `signal.value = 2` retuns (and result has been updated to `2`),
    /// `onValue()` with `1` will continue, and overriting the previous result of `2` with `1`.
    /// Whereas if we add exclusivity as well, `onValue()` with `1` will complete before `onValue()` with `2` is
    /// called and hence result will be the expected value of `2`
